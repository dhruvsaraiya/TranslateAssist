Place Gujarati transliteration model files here.

If you prune the ai4bharat-transliteration package, copy only the required
Gujarati model artifacts (tokenizer, vocab, weights). Adjust transliteration_engine.py
initialization to load from assets via Android asset extraction if needed.

This placeholder keeps the directory in version control.
