- **Gujarati Translation**: Supports English to Gujarati
- **On-Demand Translation**: Only activates when you tap the overlay button
- **Text Selection Support**: Can translate selected text or recent messages
- **Copy Functionality**: Easy copy translated text to clipboard
- **Offline Translation**: Uses Google ML Kit for offline translation

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android device with API level 23+ (Android 6.0+)
- Android Studio for development
- WhatsApp installed on the device

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TranslateAssist/android
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to the `android` folder and open it

3. **Build the project**:
   - Let Android Studio sync the project
   - Build → Make Project
   - Run → Run 'app' (or use Ctrl+R)

4. **Install on device**:
   - Connect your Android device
   - Enable USB debugging
   - Install the APK

### App Setup

1. **Open TranslateAssist app**
2. **Grant Overlay Permission**:
   - Tap "Start Overlay" 
   - You'll be redirected to system settings
   - Enable "Display over other apps" for TranslateAssist

3. **Enable Accessibility Service**:
   - Tap "Enable Accessibility Service"
   - Go to Settings → Accessibility → TranslateAssist
   - Turn on the service

4. **Start the Overlay**:
   - Return to the app
   - Tap "Start Overlay" 
   - You should see a green floating button

## Usage

### Basic Translation
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Navigate to any chat
3. Tap the floating green button
4. View translation in the popup
5. Copy translated text if needed

### Text Selection Mode
1. In WhatsApp, select specific text
2. Tap the floating button
3. Only the selected text will be translated

### Supported Languages
- **English → Gujarati**: Full translation support
- **Gujarati (already Gujarati)**: Displayed as-is

## How It Works

### Architecture
```
WhatsApp Text → Accessibility Service → Language Detection → Translation Engine → Popup Display
```

### Key Components

1. **OverlayService**: Creates and manages the floating button
2. **TranslateAccessibilityService**: Reads text from WhatsApp using accessibility APIs
3. **TranslationEngine**: Handles language detection and translation using Google ML Kit
4. **TranslationPopup**: Displays results in an overlay popup

### Text Extraction Process
1. User taps overlay button
2. Accessibility service reads WhatsApp's UI elements
3. Extracts text from TextViews and similar components
4. Filters for message-like content
5. Passes text to translation engine

### Translation Process
1. Detect input language (English or Gujarati)
2. For English: Translate to Gujarati using ML Kit
3. For Gujarati: Display as-is
4. Show result in popup with copy option

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All translation happens on-device using Google ML Kit
- **No Data Collection**: No user data is sent to external servers
- **WhatsApp Only**: Accessibility service only monitors WhatsApp
- **On-Demand**: Only activates when overlay button is tapped
- **Personal Use**: Designed for individual use, not distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Button Not Appearing
- Check if overlay permission is granted
- Restart the overlay service from the main app
- Ensure the app hasn't been killed by battery optimization

### Text Not Being Extracted
- Verify accessibility service is enabled and running
- Check if WhatsApp has been updated (may affect text extraction)
- Try selecting text manually before tapping the button

### Translation Not Working
- Ensure internet connection for initial model download
- Check if translation models are downloaded (happens automatically)
- Verify the text is in a supported language

### Performance Issues
- The app only processes text when button is tapped
- Clear recent apps if memory is low
- Restart the accessibility service if needed

## Development Notes

### Key Files
- `MainActivity.kt`: Main app interface and permission handling
- `OverlayService.kt`: Floating button implementation
- `TranslateAccessibilityService.kt`: WhatsApp text extraction
- `TranslationEngine.kt`: Language detection and translation logic
- `TranslationPopup.kt`: Result display popup

### Permissions Used
- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`: For overlay functionality
- `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`: For reading WhatsApp text
- `INTERNET`: For downloading translation models
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: For persistent overlay service
### Dependencies
- Google ML Kit Translation: Offline translation
- Google ML Kit Language ID: Language detection
- AndroidX libraries: Modern Android development
<!-- Transliteration feature removed: documentation simplified to translation-only scope. -->
### Model Files
Place Gujarati-specific tokenizer and weight files (if manually pruning) inside:
```
android/app/src/main/assets/xlit/gu/
```
Update `transliteration_engine.py` init logic to load from assets (copy to internal storage on first run) if you move away from bundled pip installation.

### Threading
All Python transliteration runs on a background dispatcher (`Dispatchers.IO`). Do not call it from main thread directly unless already inside a coroutine.

### Fallback Logic Order
```
Embedded Python (Chaquopy) → AI4Bharat Batch API → AI4Bharat Word API → (return original text)
```

### Disabling Python Path
If APK size is a concern and you want to disable temporarily, comment out the `install "ai4bharat-transliteration==..."` line in the `python { pip { } }` section of `app/build.gradle` and optionally remove the Chaquopy plugin.
